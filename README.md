## Summary
Carrier, NAS (National Aviation Services), and Late Aircraft Delays cause most of the total delays in US air traffic. Surprisingly, weather accounts for a much smaller share of delays, and security delays represent a tiny share. There is systematic seasonal variation in delays, with summer months being particularly prone to delays, but there is also substantial variation across years. As airlines can do little to mitigate delays imposed by NAS, measures to improve performance should focus on carrier delays (due to e.g. ) and in particular late aircraft delays, as delayed aircraft scheduled for upcoming flights will also be delayed (i.e. a compound effect).
