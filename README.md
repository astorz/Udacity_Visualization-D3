# Udacity - Data Visualization project: Performance of US flights

## Summary
Carrier, NAS (National Aviation Services), and Late Aircraft Delays cause most of the total delays in US air traffic. Surprisingly, weather accounts for a much smaller share of total delays, and security delays represent a tiny portion. There is systematic seasonal variation in delays, with summer months being particularly prone to delays, but there is also substantial variation across years. As airlines can do little to mitigate delays imposed by NAS, measures to improve flight performance should focus on carrier delays (due to e.g. maintenance or crew problems, aircraft cleaning, baggage loading, fueling, etc.) and in particular late aircraft delays, as delayed aircraft scheduled for upcoming flights will cause further delays (i.e. a compound effect).
